This repository contains code enabling repetition of the MR analyses desribed in Bond TA, Bhatta L, Yang Q, Moen G-H, Wang G, Beaumont R, et al. Parental body mass index and offspring cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood: an intergenerational Mendelian randomization study. medrXiv. 2025.

The R script "mr_analysis.R" reproduces the main MR analyses, via data provided in "parental_bmi_mr_SUPPLEMENTARY_TABLES.xlsx" available as supplementary material on medrXiv.

The full summary statistics from our parental GWAS of offspring cardiovascular risk factors will be made freely available at https://www.ntnu.edu/web/hunt/mce/family once the peer reviewed publication goes live, enabling users to test for causal effects of other parental exposures on offspring adulthood cardiovascular risk factors.
